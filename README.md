## Overview
Sparkify, is a Udacity dataset designed to be similar to dataflows expected from a big data music service such as Spotify or Pandora. It is a log of user activity, with demographic information, ratings, music browsing habits etc. The aim of the project is to analyse this data, and via the Pyspark library for python, apply machine learning models in an attempt to accurately predict CHURN (the likelihood of a customer ending the service).  The model that was built, achieved an F1 score of .8 and an accuracy of .82.
